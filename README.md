Start your minecraft server remotely from anywhere anytime


IMPORTANT: YOU NEED TO PORT FORWARD AT PORT 3902 ONLY. IF YOU WANT TO PORT FORWARD TO ANY OTHER PORT PLEASE CHANGE THE PORT IN THE PYTHON FILES.
           ALSO CHANGE THE IP. MAKE SURE THE IP IS OF THE MACHINE WHICH RUNS THE `server.py`
           
Having issues? join https://discord.gg/xueg8Quthx 

`server.py` should be hosted at all times in the machine which runs the minecraft server as well.
`client.py` to be given to the person who wants to turn on the server remotely.

If the machine hosting the server.py is in a lan network make sure to port forward or else it might not work. 
And if the machine hosting the server.py is in a lan network please make sure the ip inside the client.py is of the lan network.

Once everything is done, just make sure you run the server.py and client.py and you should probably figure your way out. if not, join our discord and get immidiate help!
